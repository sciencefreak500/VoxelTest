# VoxelTest
This is a Voxel engine, just to see if I can do it.

It is very basic, all that really is done is:

1) Generate a 3D grid of vertexes using nested for loops
2) Take these vertex points, see if they form quads, and create a Quad List

What is needed to be done:

1) Optimize quad ID, so that unseen quads do not get drawn
2) Push all this data to actually run with OpenGL
3) move the camera around to see the world around me
4) other game engine, movement openGL stuff
5) Modify vertex data, add noise, variation, for cool new terrains
6) and so much more!

All this is just a playground for me, if you feel like forking, go right ahead!
If you have suggestions, tell me, I'm always willing to learn!
